# Relative Shows

## Center Location Setting

The center location is the location to which all other effects of the show will be relative to when playing the show at another location. You can edit this setting through the Settings Editor.

## Play At Command

If you have a show set up like the left side of the image and want to play the same show at the coordinates `x1, y1, z1,` you can use the command `/em playat <category> <name> <world> x1, y1, z1`. This will result in the set up shown at the right side of the screen. It'll play the same show, but at a different location.
